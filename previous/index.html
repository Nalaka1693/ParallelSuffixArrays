          We researched numerous parallel approaches to suffix array constructions, both on the CPU, and GPU. We found an excellent source which provides background and a complete taxonomy of the types of suffix array construction algorithms (SACAs) and the varying implementations over the past 30 years. This paper is Puglisi et. al's <a href="http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~bill/best/algorithms/07Taxonomy.pdf"> Taxonomy of Suffix Array Construction</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read the following papers describing suffix array construction on the CPU:
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5851">Parallel Suffix Array Construction by Accelerated Sampling </a></li>
            <li> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1417v1.pdf">An Elegant Algorithm for the Construction of Suffix Arrays </a></li>
            <li> <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7152610&tag=1"> Parallel DC3 Algorithm for Suffix Array Construction on Many-Core Accelerators </a></li>
            <li> <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6eeb/4c131cb4039821208e7cb756395810aa9a0a.pdf"> Parallel Lightweight Wavelet Tree, Suffix Array and FM-Index Construction </a></li>
          </ul>
          In addition, the following papers were for construction on the GPU:
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2442536">Parallel suffix array and least common prefix for the GPU </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-48096-0_44">Fast Parallel Suffix Array on the GPU </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/62/chp%253A10.1007%252F978-3-642-34109-0_40.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-642-34109-0_40&token2=exp=1460874530~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F62%2Fchp%25253A10.1007%25252F978-3-642-34109-0_40.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Fchapter%252F10.1007%252F978-3-642-34109-0_40*~hmac=bd75e4bf5dde89b600c11b5dadb0c223dbced01ab18013c5cceaf51e46210c06">Parallel Suffix Array Construction for Shared Memory Architectures </a> </li>
          </ul>
          And finally, these were the papers on distributed suffix array construction:
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167819107000816"> Scalable parallel suffix array construction. </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2810000/2807609/a16-flick.pdf?ip=128.237.73.121&id=2807609&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=A792924B58C015C1%2E5A12BE0369099858%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&CFID=747335659&CFTOKEN=47718763&__acm__=1460868043_d6df6e9218c458c4b26bbf6fd43656f0"> Parallel Distributed Memory Construction of Suffix and Longest Common Prefix Arrays </a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We also downloaded and tried to run Guy Blelloch's <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/benchmarks/suffixArray.html"> PBBS (Problem Based Benchmark Suite) for suffix arrays </a>, in which there are implementations of the CPU based parallel DC3 and Prefix doubling algorithms. The benchmark code segfaulted when run in parallel on almost all of the larger (>10MB) datasets. We were not able to find the errors and fix the benchmark.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the numerous available and likely highly-optimized implementations of parallel suffix array construction on the CPU, and recent literature on GPU based construction, and the complications in running Guy's benchmark suite, we decided that simply doing CPU and GPU based suffix array construction would not benefit our learning the most. It would also be difficult to implement faster versions using the same algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
          We instead switched our focus to distributed suffix array construction algorithms. Most of the papers we read were only able to run on data sets of at most 2GB, which can be small, if you are dealing with areas which generally used large datasets (genomics). We want to build a distributed suffix array construction which can handle datasets of 10-30GB while achieving high parallelism. We plan to utilize Latedays to test our algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The papers described in the distributed section show approaches to both parallel DC3 and parallel Prefix doubling. The algorithm for prefix doubling is fairly complex, and in the paper, the testbed was 1024-1600 cores. We believe that on a smaller system like Latedays, parallel DC3 will be the better option since it has less overhead. We plan on building our suffix array construction algorithm using ideas from the Kulla and Sanders paper. As a stretch goal, we will try to implement the other algorithm as well to provide a comparison.

        <p>We are going to implement parallel suffix array construction on the latedays cluster. We plan on implementing both a multithreaded CPU algorithm and a CUDA GPU-based algorithm, and compare our performance to existing benchmarks.</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>
        <p>A suffix array is a data structure that stores the suffixes of a word in sorted order. It stores an array which at entry i stores the starting index of the lexicographically ith smallest suffix. The suffix array is related to the suffix tree data structure, but uses a smaller memory footprint (5 times less) and has the benefit of cache locality.
          <br><br>
          Suffix arrays are used in numerous compression algorithms, and speed up many string operations, like substring search. Hence increased performance from either multithreaded or CUDA accelerated programs greatly impacts the ability to work and operate efficiently on large data sets.
          <br><br>
          There are two common algorithms for suffix array construction. The DC3 algorithm solves a subproblem of size 2/3, and uses to solution to create the suffix array in linear time. It works by carefully selecting a subset of suffixes and calls radix sort.
          <br><br>
          The Prefix doubling algorithm works by sorting suffixes by first 1 character, then by first 2 characters, then by first 4 characters, then by first 8 characters, and so on. It often uses radix sorting.
          <br><br>
          The papers listed below in Resources describe variants and improvements to the above algorithms.
        </p>
        <h3>
        <a id="challenges" class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          For the prefix-doubling algorithm, each round of sorting depends on the previous round of sorting. Sorting doesn't have a great amount of locality and has considerable divergence. Also, prefixes are put in buckets as sorting occurs, but the distrbution of data within the buckets is data-dependent and will likely be non-uniform. This leads to load imbalance.
          <br><br>
          For the DC3 algorithm, the recursive structure creates many dependencies. In addition, it uses some comparison-based sorting and merging, which can be expensive for strings.
          <br><br>
          We must figure out which algorithm is fastest and find ways to mitigate its flaws.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, GPUs have limited memory, so when we divide up work, we must find a reasonable way to portion the large inputs into chunks such that we minimize communication requirements and maximize locality.

          <ul>
            <li> Write an implementation for the CPU that is about as fast as the PBBS implementation. This should be achievable if we can understand the algorithm in the PBBS implementation. It's not clear whether or not we can reasonably get significant speedup. </li>
            <li> Write an implementation for the GPU that is significantly faster than the PBBS implementation. Speedup is possible due to the theoretically high instruction throughput of GPUs compared to CPUs. </li>
